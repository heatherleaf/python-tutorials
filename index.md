# Python tutorials

Here are some iPython notebooks and other tutorials and code snippets that I'd like to share (as of now there is only one, but more could perhaps come later).

Please do with them whatever you choose - they are published under the MIT license. Comments are welcome - you can suggest changes in the [github issues](https://github.com/heatherleaf/python-tutorials/issues).

### Tutorial: Earley-style chart parsing

- [interactive iPython notebook](chartparser-tutorial.ipynb)
- [the same notebook as a static web page](chartparser-tutorial.html)
